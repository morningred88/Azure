## 4.2   Create business process flow

I tried to create a business process flow related to my model-driven app in Power Automate, but there is no business process flow option available.

But I find a vlog and shows you can directly create a business process flow in the Power Apps. (https://vblogs.in/solvedcustom-business-process-flow-is-not-showing-in-model-driven-app/)

Model-drive apps > Three dots>Edit> select classic designer> Choose business process flows in the designer> Click create new on the right hand side> Give the name and table selected, then a new business process flow has been created. 

Validate>save>activate

After this, click Business process flows in the designer again, you can see the business has showed up. 

Save and publish. 



## 4.3   Add details to business process flow

Add stage and steps details in the business process flow. 

Validate>save>activate

Then save>publish

Test:

Go to pet page > click new, the business process flow then show up.
